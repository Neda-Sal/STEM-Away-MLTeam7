https://sellercentral.amazon.com/forums/t/inventory-placement-question/643588,"I don’t think this is accurate.  Amazon doesn’t care how you’ve packed your items – they will make you repack them.  They may (and probably will) ask the OP to split that shipment of 50 into 3 boxes of 20, 24 and 6 going to three different fulfillment centers.If available, the best way to ship to one warehouse is to mark your shipment as case packs.  Amazon will not split a case pack into separate shipments and there is no charge like with Inventory Placement.  But there are rules for case packs, not all shipments qualify."

Very interesting how 548 items that were  declared “missing” have now appeared.First note from Seller Support clearly stated, for lack of better words, for me to go pound sand and I would be out $5400:Hello from Amazon Selling Partner Support,I understand that you requested to investigate the missing units on shipment FBA15L98Y0DY.Upon checking, I confirmed that this shipment has claimed missing units that are marked as “Investigation Completed - shipment contents counted and confirmed.”Whenever we have an instance where the number of units expected is different from the number of units received, an investigation is done by our warehouse as part of the receiving process. During the investigation, our fulfillment centers perform a second, physical count to reconfirm the quantity of the items received and they concluded that these units claimed missing were not physically received. Therefore, ineligible for further investigation and reimbursement.Second response from Seller Support reasserted I was wrong, Amazon was right, I should go pound sand, and have a nice day.Hello from Amazon Selling Partner Support,When we receive shipments with quantity discrepancies, we automatically initiate an investigation on your behalf for the items in your shipment.This resolution has been provided earlier by another associate, and it will not be different this time.As part of this investigation, we perform a second, physical count to reconfirm the quantity of the items received. Items are marked “Investigation Completed – shipment contents counted and confirmed” when we have completed the investigation.We have completed an additional check in response to your request. We have no record of receiving the units in question.To help us continually improve, we ask that you take a moment to complete our survey below to tell us about your experience with this specific interaction.Were you satisfied with the support provided?  (NO!!!)I obviously sent some hot email responses to Seller Support.  Not directing fault to anyone specifically, but I essentially declared shenanigans and the response was unacceptable.  I believe the third email asking for direct evidence of the boxes as either being missing or the boxes empty as UPS did show the boxes as delivered made something click.  Eagerly awaiting the response, but I am very relieved that I see inventory in progress now.I am still miffed by the whole situation though.  I raised this issue as business critical.  I did receive a very timely response and I appreciate the timely response, but I was told I was wrong and that what was in the computer on their end was right and that I have no recourse.  Unless there is another means of escalating or getting some level of support to take a second look, it puts sellers in a difficult situation.  If an Amazon mediator reads this thread and is able to take this one back to the support teams and collaborate with the operations teams to create a better path for actual escalation and resolution, I feel it would save a lot of people some serious heartburn and improve overall processes for both Amazon and sellers."

Check your received Inventory report to get a more accurate idea of what has been received.  Also your inventory Event Detail shows where items are located day by day. Although it seems incomprehensible that items could be missed when checked in, I think the systems for receiving and for shipping to other FBA warehouses do not communicate very well.  Even though your items are showing as not received, I suspect they are and are in the redistribution process.For my inventory, sometimes items are marked received when they arrive at the initial warehouse and identical items that are in the same box are marked received when they get to their final warehouse.

A small loss of 230 CAD but definitely something what makes me worry to send more value to FBA.Totally our fault that we didn’t videotape this one shipment. All others were recorded when packaged.And there seems to be difference in the way they receive shipments, since this never happened with the warehouse in Brampton (Ontario) where we shipped about 25 parcels since beginning of the year, but it happened both times with the only 2 shipments we had to deliver to the warehouse in Bolton (Ontario). Now we make sure that no scannable label is visible on the outside, and receiving staff needs to open the bags to remove the single products from them, before they can see the barcodes. And of course, big labels on the bags like “This bag contains 25 single items of SKU xxxxx” have always been in place and were ignored both times.The size of this company makes it impossible to actually hit the people who deserve it. Complaints are handled by first responders, and nothing less serious than a warning about a product which could explode within 24 hours will ever be important enough to make it through all the hierarchical structures down to the person who opens the shipments and checks the content in."

With certain exceptions, a pesticide is any substance or mixture of substances intended for preventing, destroying, repelling, or mitigating any pest, or intended for use as a plant regulator, defoliant, or desiccant, or desiccant, or any nitrogen stabilizer. FIFRA defines a device as any instrument or contrivance (other than a firearm) that is intended for trapping, destroying, repelling, or mitigating any pest or any other form of plant or animal life (other than man and other than bacteria, virus, or other microorganism on or in living man or other living animals); but not including equipment used for the application of pesticides when sold separately therefrom.Now just because a chemical or device can or does kill or control a pest does not make it a pesticide or pesticide device. For example boots are effective for killing spiders, obviously boots are not pesticide devices. Why? Because, the manufacturer, distributor, or retailer does not claim that the boot kills spiders. It is the marketing claims (or implied claims) which make something a pesticide and regulated under FIFRA. So if you claim your device kills bacteria, viruses then it becomes a pesticide device.Any pesticide or pesticide device must be manufactured, packaged in an EPA registered facility the establishments number must be printed in no less than 6 point font on the device and/or packaging. Any pesticide must have an approved Registration label, this label must fully be visible to consumers on the packaging in no less than 6 point font. All claims must be supported by data owned by the manufacturer or distributor.The FDA has jurisdiction over human health products and drugs, so if your device makes claims regarding human health, for example “prevents disease” or kills “germs” then it is no longer under the jurisdiction of the EPA jurisdiction and regulation passes to the FDA.If you intend to sell a pesticide or pesticide device on Amazon under a master settlement between the EPA and Amazon all third party sellers must complete and pass with at least 80% a required pesticide module which can be found in Amazon Seller Central. I suggest that you begin there, since you will need to successfully complete it anyway. This module has a lot of good information, about FIFRA although it is not comprehensive, you will have enough information to know if your device must be registered under FIFRA.Since 1972 FIFRA has been under the jurisdiction of the EPA (Thank you Richard Nixon). For more information, to approve a label, or register an establishment visit the EPA’s website."

Here are the basics:-Select Amazon as your fulfillment service for each product to be fulfilled by Amazon.-Go to Settings>Shipping Settings and add 3 shipping rates that coincide with Amazon’s shipping speeds. The Rate Names are as follows: Standard Shipping, Priority Shipping and Expedited Shipping. Standard Shipping is a required shipping speed. Priority and Expedited shipping speeds are optional and you would not set these up if you are not planning on offering these options. The shipping “Rate Name” you add in Shopify must be named/spelled exactly as shown above or your fulfillment request will fail.If you want to give free shipping over $50, then you would need to use the price condition. The other 2 shipping speeds should charge enough to cover your fulfillment fees and should be based on weight according to the Amazon MCF fee schedule for those speeds relative to your product tier.This information is covered in the Shopify online support guide, although it can be difficult sometimes to find what you’re looking for.Good Luck and feel free to private message me if you need more help."

I’ve gotten a box with a light crush-able items shipped in a huge box with a heavy box of reams of paper, only packaging material is like a large piece of paper, flip that over a few times and the crush-able item is well crushed.I’m very happy that the items I’m selling are not breakable in any way (well, I’m sure fire or running them through a fan or gear box could cause damage but otherwise they actually make really good packaging material for anything else in the box with them.)  I just have to polly bag my stuff since it is fabric.But, if your item can be damaged by dropping it or tossing it around, then make sure the packaging you send it in is adequate to protect it in the warehouse and in shipping.  If that means taping the manufacturers box shut and bubble wrapping it or placing it in a shipping box, then that will have to be factored into your business calculations on the price you need to charge for the product or choose to pull the product and sell elsewhere or ship it yourself."

This is going to change the dimensions some for the product so it will likely impact the FBA fees a little (the cubic space your products take in the warehouses.)  But at this point you need to get your products back and do some packaging testing.

That is on top of the movement between warehouses.USA is in a Pandemic. Essential products, such as medical related supplies get priority. If you are selling non-essential items, it could be several weeks before it ships.Right now, you should update your non-Amazon sales channels with lower turn-around expectations.

Do they have some kind of monopoly on the barcode industry? Why aren’t they like domain names which are $10.Furthermore, you have to decide how many barcodes you will need, from now into perpetuity, like NOW. I don’t understand that. I may only have 10 products, but what if, in 5 years, I go to that 11th product? That screws up their whole numbering system, because you have to decide that up front, like, right now (company prefix + 00, 000, 0000, number of products). And if you leave room for the future potentiality of having 10+ products, then you have to pay for that up front, hundreds of dollars more now, when you don’t know if that will happen. This seems incredibly stupid. This all seems incredibly tedious and as if, as if no one thought it through. Again, I’m new to this, so I’m a newbie just trying to understand."

If that’s true, then the checking is almost useless to even prove the user has owned that code authoritatively.

For a fee per unit Amazon will have you send your items to the same destination. You can activate it in:Seller Central > Settings > FBA > Inbound Settings > Inventory Placement OptionsRegarding your OP, Amazon sent out cases to customers because you didn’t tell them that your units were in cases, and as you said, you didn’t mention that in order to prevent the inbound shipment from getting split up.Another work around that you could try is to create a shipping plan for 140 cases (2 pallets) to see if those all get allocated to the same FC.

While it’s possible that you can get more on another platform, if a book is selling for $5 on Amazon, it’s unlikely that you’ll be able to get enough anywhere to make it really worth your time listing; by the time you count packaging, you might end up paying to dispose of your books.Unless a significant number of your books list for more than $10 (and that’s still really low), you would probably be better off donating them.

StoneDew:can I downscale the FNSKU label a bit to fit the area it will be affixed to?Yes, but…I have received products with the FNSKU printed directly on them and they were difficult to read compared to the labels I print on the dymo, so they were noticeably smaller and they worked.If you have the ability to print a high quality label you can create a few mock ups and test them with the camera icon in the mobile Amazon seller app to see how easily and accurately they scan.In what kind of packaging do you ship these tubes? Since FBA orders aren’t guaranteed to be shipped individually, if you think that your tube will require a little extra protection in case it’s packaged up with something that might crush it you could always put it in a standard size box and put the FNSKU label on that. It adds an extra step and expense but it will better ensure the integrity of the item during its journey from you to Amazon to the customer."
https://sellercentral.amazon.com/forums/t/fnsku-labels-and-prep-centers-gtin-exempt/629560,"LS27, thank you very much for your reply.Like I said, each individual product is packed into a small cardboard tube 5 inches high and 5 inches in diameter. This is the final unit which is shipped to the customer. Currently I am using a 3rd party fulfillment company which ships my customers’ orders using regular USPS padded envelopes (they fit OK). For transportation these individual units are grouped into a master carton, each of those cartons containing 147 individual units with added protection inside these boxes (bubble wrap all around and in-between the layers, all safe (at least all withstood transportation from one state to another via FedEx).I was thinking of sending these master cartons to an FBA center just as they are, my only concern now is that I need to somehow “unload” the master cartons, affix the FNSKU labels to each and every of those individual tubes, then “load” all of them back into the master carton boxes (17x17x7 inch each) and only then be able to ship them to an FBA center."

So you are going to have to take those out and label them.I’m a little confused why you can’t put a 3 inch label on the bottom of a 5"" diameter tube.  But assuming you can’t, it is possible to print FNSKU labels smaller than the standard 1 x 3 – within reason.  I often get small electronic items with smaller FNSKU labels.  Just make sure the print quality is high and they can be reliably scanned.  I have never read anything that says FNSKU labels must be 1 x 3.  I think the confusion comes from the fact that you use 1 x 3 labels when you print Amazon’s default label printing software and people misinterpret that to mean the FNSKU labels themselves always have to be 1 x 3.Of course you could put your own UPC barcode on the bottom of the tubes and that could be any size, but if you are going to do that you might as well put the FNSKU sticker there and save the labeling cost."

Well someone screwed up and the label did not include a bar code. So the owner, myself, and a few of our friends went to the co-packer and had to put labels on every single bottle in multiple pallets. It took many hours because they were just packed 100-200 bottles per layer with a piece of thick paper between then and then the whole thing got shrink-wrapped. Luckily they weren’t already in shrink-wrapped cases or anything. Thousands and thousands of bottles that we stuck labels on by hand. Eventually we started putting it on the top of the lid rather than the side in the blank area where the UPC should have been. And then there was the separate issue that the bottle caps were over-tightened and it took far more effort than should have been necessary to crack the seal and open it up."

https://sellercentral.amazon.com/forums/t/amazon-has-sidelined-fulfilling-fba-products-wont-deliver-for-a-month-to-prime-customers/596076,"I’m guessing it has to do with the algorithm that decides which warehouse will ship an item to you. If the warehouse that is designated to be the one to ship to you is having issues, then there is a delay; if not, then shipping is closer to normal. So different buyers in different locations may see different shipping times.We have to remember that Amazon doesn’t have this scenario programmed into their systems. They are trying to make their existing protocols work with an insane situation."
https://sellercentral.amazon.com/forums/t/amazon-has-sidelined-fulfilling-fba-products-wont-deliver-for-a-month-to-prime-customers/596076,It seems like delivery times are varying from 7 days (for some toys) to as much as 45 days. I can’t imagine why it would take 45 days to ship an item to a customer. That seems absurd even given the current situation. Could you imagine what Amazon would do to us if we took 45 days to deliver items via FBM to their customers?Walmart still offers next day delivery on thousands of items. Why can Walmart deliver in one day and it takes Amazon 30 to 45 days? That just makes no sense at all. It does make sense why our sales have increased by about 400% on Walmart in the last week. I didn’t have any idea what was going on at first but now it’s clear. People aren’t going to shop on a site that shows half their items with a 30 to 45 day delivery window. Even a 400% increase on Walmart doesn’t compete with our Amazon sales but it definitely helps. Ebay is also up about 100% for us in the last week.FBM sales have also increased on Amazon. I guess FBM is the new FBA. I can ship out an order next day and the customer will have it in 2 to 5 days. If it takes Amazon 30 to 45 days they should start prioritizing FBM over FBA.

It’s unlikely to have an effect on your existing website sales, but it could definitely add a whole new revenue source to your business.Amazon offers ‘Multi-channel fulfilment’ which allows you to essentially copy orders from your website or any other marketplace and have them fulfilled from an Amazon warehouse.However, if you just need the fulfilment facilities then there are other companies which do this that are much less expensive than Amazon. Amazon charges higher fees for FBA if the product was not sold on their site. But, if you’re selling on Amazon and your website then FBA is the way to go and is what I do since I live in the UK but most of my orders are in the USA so it’s not economically to ship every order internationally.Hope this helps a bit."

My comments to all the questions/comments are below (P.S. the products I’ll be selling is under my own brand):I would consider NOT selling on Amazon and only selling on my website in the scenario where my customer acquisition costs is less than the 15% amazon charges me. If I can acquire customers through Instagram targeted Ads/influencers for a cost of lets say 10% of my selling price, then I prefer use my inventory for sales outside of Amazon which are more profitable.That being said, in case I can’t reach high volumes through my other avenues of advertising (or my customer acquisition cost is higher than 15%), I’ll then want to turn on the amazon listing as well. This is why I’d like to use FBA and not another fulfillment center - so I can easily toggle on Amazon sales if necessary.@YeStore_Posters thanks for the Multi-Fulfillment Comment. Sounds like this is the avenue to utilizing FBA without listing a product on Amazon. I will do some research on this (any further insight from you on this matter can be helpful). At the same time, I will start looking into other fulfillment providers - putting cost aside for a moment, how much better or worse are they than FBA?"

The most cost effective shipping method is ocean freight. It is most effective for larger (multi-pallet) shipments. Small shipments will not see the same savings. Ocean freight shipments are multi-modal and the ocean component will take the longest. If you need your products quickly and margins can absorb the costs for air freight, you can consider it. Smaller shipments will see less of an impact.

Amazon will automatically change the dimensions when they examine them.A new MSKU with a resulting new FNSKU is not a bad idea, just duplicate the offer and assign the new one a different MSKU.  Don’t worry about losing reviews – those are tied to ASINs, and you can’t change that.Unless the differences are large I don’t think there will be any issues with Amazon receiving your newly packaged inventory even using its current info.Actually you can have more than one FBA offer active at a time.  I sometimes do that to encourage stock rotation out of the FBA warehouse.  Just do not try to pad the listing with your offers to cut any other sellers out.  You also can have simultaneous FBA and FBM offers – they just have to have different MSKUs."

I have problems with FBA and my suppliers but I work around or live with them for now.  If you are concerned about your FBA inventory, gear up to sell FBM during your critical window and ship them yourself.  No one is stopping you from listing your items.The only thing that is normal in my supply chain is UPS.  Thank you UPS."

https://sellercentral.amazon.com/forums/t/michele-clark/601954,It’s basically an alias for Amazon.  They want people to think they have sold out of a product when actually THEY ARE MICHELE CLARK.

https://sellercentral.amazon.com/forums/t/michele-clark/601954,Michele Clark is Amazon.
https://sellercentral.amazon.com/forums/t/michele-clark/601954,"Amazon is now always displayed as “Michele Clark” in the Amazon Seller App.  You can look at any listing on Amazon where Amazon is a seller, type the ASIN into “Add a product” in the seller app, look at all of the other competitors and Michele Clark will be the prime seller that is displayed for that particular listing.  I don’t think there is anything sinister going on here, they probably just did that for internal reasons. Maybe all Amazon listings are under that account so someone can keep tabs on them more easily?  Maybe the name of the existing Amazon account got changed by mistake?"
https://sellercentral.amazon.com/forums/t/michele-clark/601954,Some people hate AMAZON and refuse to buy from them.  Therefore if they think they are buying from a lady named Michelle Clark but really it’s AMAZON!!! HAHA…THEY TRICKED YOU!!!

https://sellercentral.amazon.com/forums/t/can-we-paste-fba-box-id-label-and-the-carrier-label-on-different-side-of-the-box/620001,Putting both labels on one side is relatively new guidance. In the past I had always placed the FBA label on top and the shipping label on the side. If both labels won’t physically fit on one side of the box I think you’ll be OK.
https://sellercentral.amazon.com/forums/t/can-we-paste-fba-box-id-label-and-the-carrier-label-on-different-side-of-the-box/620001,Thank you for the quick reply.I was worried because it was mentioned as “only 1 side of the box” on the FBA shipment Instructions.
https://sellercentral.amazon.com/forums/t/one-product-with-color-variation-but-being-charged-two-different-fees/620100,Sounds like you need to request a cubiscan.
https://sellercentral.amazon.com/forums/t/one-product-with-color-variation-but-being-charged-two-different-fees/620100,I will open a ticket and make that specific request. I take it cubiscan is a known service or request? Thanks for the suggestion.Let me mention that one of the prior ticket specifically requested that they review and measure the product package. This did not result in a change. Not certain what method was used to measure. A simple view can easily ascertain there is no difference one to the other than the color in the package.

Wrong Items Fulfilled,Fulfillment By Amazon,FBA Orders and Customer Service,"I have been selling here for just over 6 months, I do strictly FBA and I only buy from distributors. One of my listings was deactivated the other day due to a high amount of negative reviews. I checked it out, and 100% of the complaints were “wrong item sent.”After doing some more digging, I saw that a few other items were getting mixed up, too. Customers are being sent other items from my inventory. It all stems from the same FBA shipment. This is not a labeling error on my part - all items come with manufacturer label. (I do commingle, I understand I should change this - could that be the issue here? They are still items from my own inventory that are being sent, just the wrong item.) Not only do they have manufacturer barcodes, but these particular items are prepped and sent to Amazon by me, and I inspect each item. They were also all checked in and received properly.The only thing I can think is that this is a fulfillment issue. I find it highly unlikely (but I guess not impossible) that the distributor sent mislabeled items and that it somehow made it past me during prep. Still, should I recall these items for inspection and then resend them for fulfillment? I reactivated the listing because it is a big seller, but I don’t want to lose these listings if any other issues arise. I’ve opened a case but I’m not sure what I should do in the meantime.",https://sellercentral.amazon.com/forums/t/wrong-items-fulfilled/643954

FBA Merchandise Marked as Expired in ERROR then disposed!,Fulfillment By Amazon,Fulfillment By Amazon,"Well my absolute nightmare scenario occurred over the last week and I am absolutely LIVID about it! I have a single product I sell on amazon in the pet space. The product has a 2 year shelf life. I sell a small but steady amount of it daily on amazon via FBA. Around last Wednesday I started to notice my sales went from the normal 5-10 units a day to 0. On the first day I chalked it off as a fluke. On day 2 I decided to dig a bit deeper. It turns out Amazon INCORRECTLY flagged all 430 units I had in their warehouses as expired. This is simply NOT POSSIBLE given this inventory was only manufactured several months ago and has a 2 year shelf life. OCTOBER 2021 expiration date to be exact.Immediately I opened a case. It took 3 attempts to even get through to someone who spoke fluent english because the first 2 attempts were routed to who knows what country to people who not only were unable to communicate with me verbally but they must have been talking from dial up modems because there phone connection was terrible.On the 3rd attempt I was routed to someone here in the US. The person on the phone said that the system applying an “incorrect expiration” are a known issue on the platform and they were going to put an immediate request to have the units manually inspected for the correct expiration dates and once verified, they would be put back into my active inventory. This was on Friday of last week.Today I get a message from the open case that was created from the inbound call that there is nothing I can do to get the inventory put back to active since there is already a open disposal order.I log into my dashboard and I see that amazon has ALREADY DISPOSED OF 280 perfectly good sellable units of my inventory WITHOUT MY CONSENT OR ANY NOTIFICATION whatsoever. All this while not 1 but 2 open cases on this exact subject were open.I am not an attorney but I can not possibly fathom that this type of practice could be LEGAL ANYWHERE. I am absolutely livid!

Amazon will not removed feedback on FBA service related comment,Fulfillment By Amazon,FBA Orders and Customer Service,"I have received seller feedback regarding an FBA order that was never received, and Amazon support says that it does not violate their policy so they will not remove. I have read several other accounts from other sellers regarding the lack of removal or action by Amazon on these, but this one seems very cut and dry to me. What am I missing? This is the feedback in question:From Buyer:going on 20 days for a _______ I still haven’t receivedHere is the very brief conversation that I had with support, trying to resolve this:Order xxxxxxxx was fulfilled by Amazon, and the feedback is solely relating to the non-receipt of the order. According to Amazon policy, Amazon will remove feedback when it meets the following criteria: “The entire feedback comment is regarding fulfillment or customer service for an order fulfilled by Amazon.”I ask politely to have this feedback removed as it violates the above policy. Thank you.Amazon responded:Hello from Amazon Selling Partner Support,We’re unable to remove this feedback because the package was shipped late and the buyer left feedback after the latest Estimated Delivery Date.Since buyer feedback is a direct reflection of their Amazon shopping experience, we can only remove feedback for these reasons:Contains obscene language.Contains seller-specific, personally identifiable information.Entire feedback comment is a product review.Entire feedback comment is about fulfillment or customer service for an order fulfilled by Amazon.You may ask buyers to remove their feedback, but do not pressure them to do so. The buyer can remove the feedback if they choose to.To contact the buyer, go to the Orders tab in your Seller Account and select Manage Orders. Search for the buyer’s order, then click the buyer’s name under “Contact Buyer.”If the buyer does not remove the feedback, you can post a response to it. To do this, go to the Reports heading in your Seller Account and click “Manage your Ratings and Feedback.” From there you can look up the feedback and respond.I responded one more time reiterating that this was an FBA order and in their reply it states why the feedback should be removed, to which Amazon responded:We have reviewed our prior decision and determined that this feedback does not violate ourpolicies. This is our final decision regarding the feedback for this order.The best way to deal with negative feedback is to resolve any transaction issues with thebuyer. The buyer could then remove the feedback if they feel it is appropriate.Under Feedback Manager, you can also post a public reply under a specific feedback. Followthe steps outlined to post a public reply to specific feedback:Go to the Feedback Manager (feedback-manager/index.html).In the Recent Feedback table, next to the Order ID, select Post a public reply underthe Actions column.Please consider this matter resolved after addressing the buyer’s concern or posting apublic reply.Thank you for selling with AmazonWhat am I missing here?

(They are decorative metal trays, main usage is for rolling tobacco - So they technically fall under “adult products”)Now the question,Should I just count my blessings and let them run as they are currently? I mean… Amazon did make this decision of their own accord. I did input all my data on my listing accurately; according to my calculations anyways.OrShould I step up to the plate and tell Amazon they may have made an error, risk losing advertising ability, and pay a larger FBA fee?Anybody have a similar issue?

"Account Deactivated - Amazon Disposed of almost 10,000 units without notice. How can we get reimbursed?",Fulfillment By Amazon,General FBA Questions,"Hello,Any help is greatly appreciated so thank you in advance.We’re a relatively new seller on Amazon (started March 2019). We sell 100% of our inventory FBA. We sell mostly shoes and some clothing (all in new condition). All of our shoes are sourced directly from the manufacturer/brand owner. They provided us with invoices and authorization letters to sell their products on Amazon and advised us to jump on their existing listings that their other sellers were on (good ratings, better exposure). This means we cannot edit or modify these listings.Starting around October 2019, we started to get a few “quality complaints” about some of our shoes. We looked into it and viewed the customer comments they provided us as “proof”. Those comments were normal sizing comments such as “too large” etc. It is completely normal for a customer to buy more than one size and return the pair that did not work out as they could be between sizes. Clothing and shoes are very subjective. You can be a size 8 in one brand and 7.5 in another. Amazon customers are also serial-returners. But, Amazon took this as if there is something wrong with the shoe itself.Additionally, we received “used sold as new” complaints which is extremely hard to believe. We source our shoes directly from the manufacturer and our team can guarantee they are sent brand new as we inspect them prior to shipping. We believe FBA employees might be sending returns as new to customers by mistake. There’s no way to prove this of course and Amazon would never admit fault in this.Before anyone asks, we did not receive any “inauthentic” complaints. We understand that Amazon takes that extremely seriously and would never risk our account with fake goods.So, from October 2019 through January 2020, we receive the few complaints that we mentioned but we were not shut down. Only some listings were closed down and we made removal orders for these individual ASINs. They were not re-listed. From January 2020, it all goes downhill. We’ve summarized it in a timeline below:January 13 - Received Account Suspension notice from Amazon due to quality issues. In the message, they put specific ASINs with issues. Half of them we haven’t sold in 6+ months. They want a POA to address this. They mention editing the listing descriptions (which we can’t do because they are not our listing, it’s the brand’s listing).January 14 - sent POA to Amazon with official invoices and authorization letter from the manufacturer/brand owner.January 15 - Amazon replies to POA stating “insufficient information” and the request an updated POA. We send an updated POA that same day. We don’t even bother defending ourselves anymore. We knew it was better to just admit fault and try to tell Amazon how we will prevent further issues.January 29 - Our POA wasn’t accepted. We receive an Account Deactivation Notice from Amazon.February 3 - We send a Deactivation Appeal with a new POAFebruary 4 – March 22: We go back and forth with Amazon submitting updated POA’s and receiving “insufficient information” replies from Amazon. In total, at the time of writing this, we sent 12 unsuccessful appeals/updated POA’s to Amazon.February 7 - Deleted all products and listings from account as part of an updated POA.March 13 - We start to get worried and start initiating FBA removal orders on inventory that is more expensive or that we have a large quantity of. We get back most of the merchandise from the March 13th removal orders around March 30, but it’s worth noting that a removal order made on March 13 containing 40 more expensive items were never shipped to us as of 5/13/2020. Only the cheaper items that had a large quantity.March 20 - Stay at home orders are issued for NY due to COVID 19.March 22 - Amazon sends message stating we have not provided enough information to reactivate our account and that they may not reply to any further messages from us . The kiss of death.March 24 - Amazon forum notice letting all sellers know that they are temporarily stopping removal orders until further notice due to COVID-19 in order to prioritize shipping and receiving essential items. We thought that included us as well.April 3 - Amazon disposes of almost 10,000 units of our inventory WITHOUT notice. No one on our team is made aware of this. There’s no messages in seller performance notifications or in our email (spam too) which we try to check daily.April 15 - Receive notice from Amazon telling us to remove all inventory by May 14, 2020. or they will dispose of the inventory themselves. At that time, we were still unaware of the huge disposal order they had done on April 3. It is May 13, 2020 at the time of writing this timeline.4.15.2020 Amazon tells us to remove inventory by 5.14.2020.PNG1549×639 56.2 KBApril 16 - Amazon sends another notice to remove inventory but they changed the end date to May 16, 2020 .4.16.2020 Amazon sends second email telling us to remove inventory by 5.16.2020.PNG1613×775 65.3 KBApril 17 - Sent another appeal to Amazon to reactivate account.April 18 - Sent Jeff escalation appealApril 28 - Sent final Jeff escalation appealMay 12 - We realized there were disposal orders of almost 10,000 units done on April 3, 2020 after trying to make more removal orders. We contacted Amazon immediately to stop/cancel these orders. Or, if they were already complete, we wanted to be reimbursed since we received no notice of the disposals. We could not open any cases with Amazon as they would “only answer questions regarding account health”.So, we decided to call instead. After hours on the phone, we finally reach an Amazon rep who seems like he could help. We spoke to him on the phone and opened a case with him. He says the units were disposed of without notice due to unsuccessful appeals to reactivate our account and “due to several product quality complaints which caused products to be flagged as quality and safety concerns at the fulfillment centers with also no successful appeals to reinstate the listings, units got disposed pursuant to section 3 of the agreement in action with section F-7.2”.That’s absolutely ridiculous. Why would shoes and clothing would be flagged as a “quality and safety concern” in the first place? These are NOT hazardous goods.It’s also worth noting that the rep on the phone stated that even if we had made removal orders in advance for all these items, those orders would have be cancelled because of the so-called safety-concerns and the inventory would be disposed of at their discretion. What???As of today, we are unable to reach anyone at Amazon or open any cases with them regarding these disposal orders or any reimbursements. They will only speak to us regarding our “account health” if they even reply.At this point, we don’t care if we get reactivated or not. We’re tired of fighting for that. We just want our items back or a reimbursement for the disposed units. Like we said, they provided only notices to remove inventory by May 14/May 16. It’s only May 13. And they sent those notices on April 15/16 knowing full well they disposed of all our inventory left on April 3!Can anyone provide insight or advice of how to get reimbursed for these items?Thank you!",https://sellercentral.amazon.com/forums/t/account-deactivated-amazon-disposed-of-almost-10-000-units-without-notice-how-can-we-get-reimbursed/627968

How much weight do you give Amazon’s ‘Restock Inventory’ suggestions?,Fulfillment By Amazon,General FBA Questions,"Curious to know how much attention others pay to the ‘Restock Inventory’ suggestions that show up on the Seller Central homepage and on the ‘Restock Inventory’ tab under ‘Inventory Planning.’When Amazon first rolled out the feature, I was skeptical as a lot of the suggestions seemed off (usually too much inventory relative to previous sales). I hoped that the quality of the suggestions would improve as Amazon refined the tool, and so lately I decided to actually fill out some of the lead time information and give it a shot. (At least look at their suggestions and use that as a starting point.)The first suggestion the tool made was to send in a certain number of units for a particular product. I only had about half the number of units the tool suggested handy, so I sent those in, which was going to take me to just over a 3 month supply. (A little more than I usually send, but not unreasonable.)As soon as the shipment went out, an error message appeared beside that product on the ‘Restock Inventory’ tab.“Very high inventory level! Inventory levels in this range can negatively affect your IPI score and your inventory investment returns.”Despite the error message, that product is still showing up #1 on the ‘Restock Inventory’ list and Amazon apparently wants me to send 210 more units today.Obviously not going to do that, but the mixed messages aren’t giving me great confidence in the tool’s other suggestions…Does anyone use the ‘Restock Inventory’ tool?

How Do I Stop Amazon From Shipping My Items in Merely their Manufacturer’s Packaging?,Fulfillment By Amazon,General FBA Questions,"I sell a small product that comes in a very thin and flimsy manufacturer’s box. This box is enough to protect the item, but it is not enough to ship the item in. I have no control over the box that the manufacturer uses.Several customers have complained that their items have been horrendously damaged due to the item being only shipped in the manufacturer’s box. They write this on my seller feedback page.However, I have contacted Amazon twice, and each time they tell me that no customers have chosen for their “customer return reason” the option “product damaged.” However, I do have many customers who have chosen “Product damaged or defective prior to shipping.” In my mind though these are the same thing…how would a customer even know if the item was damaged prior to shipping if the item is shipped without a box? Its irrational.However, seller support tells me that only the “product damaged” reason will allow them to change the FBA packaging to a FBA box instead of simply slapping a label on the manufacturer’s box.The problem is that I looked at the return reasons offered for buyers on my own buyer account. There is no option for “product damaged.” There are only options for “shipping box and item damaged” or “shipping box damaged but item ok.” These reasons don’t correspond with the “customer return reasons” found on my FBA returns page.So, I am at a lost of what to do. Furthermore, Amazon has now deactivated my listing and left my FBA items stranded because they are saying that too many customers are getting damaged items.

Message from Compliance regarding cover tint of used book,Fulfillment By Amazon,Fulfillment By Amazon,"This is a new one for us. We received an e-mail from “Compliance and Exception Management” (tier2-na-escalation@amazon.com) regarding product images of one of our used books. This department sounds high tier, so we figure the issue is worth addressing. Despite a vague initial e-mail, we’ve since narrowed the problem down to a matter of an off-colored book cover.We understand that our customers deserve the proper edition and content they are expecting. We also understand that counterfeit problems are real. We’ve caught a few ourselves. Usually these are modern, valuable, textbooks or popular professional references that bad actors can print in volume, rather than an obscure niche text, the likes of which we submitted to FBA. The correspondence makes no mention of counterfeit worries, but that is the only problem we can imagine that the FC is trying to address.We do not actually believe there to be a variance in cover tint here (rather an issue of improper contrast in a poor quality “main item” photo submitted for this ASIN by another merchant), but this does conjure up other potential issues. While changes in edition, cover art, and content may warrant a new ASIN, it is simply not practical that every minor change gets a new ASIN (We’re imagining cover price changes, minor grammatical errors, and yes, natural variances in printing tone). When the ISBN remains the same, these minor changes need not clutter up Amazon’s catalog.There is another issue regarding main item photos. Many, if not most, main item photos are not in compliance with Amazon’s formatting policies. It is not prudent for us to address these instances ourselves for one-off sales, especially considering that photo submission via Amazon is time consuming and our higher quality photos may not even be accepted by support/AI. Furthermore, item photos are ever-changing. Other sellers may choose to submit their own poor quality or inaccurate photos and often the main photo is updated accordingly. Other times, Amazon’s own AI or support choose to change/merge ASINs and photos. We try to address these potential future discrepancies by being over-meticulous with our item descriptions and maintaining near 100% feedback.We are well aware that this is Amazon’s sandbox and that Amazon, their FCs, and support are in “the right” to decide what flies in their marketplace (to their or our peril…well, most likely ours). We also understand that we don’t deserve any special treatment as a 3rd Party used book merchant.We are merely asking for feedback and thoughts from the community (and perhaps we wanted to vent a little). It appears the issue is going to be resolved acceptably, but it remains a bizarre occurrence. We hope that we responded appropriately. Anyone else had similar correspondence? Are there further steps we can / should take?Following is our exchange with support to-date, including the FCs photos and ASIN photo:BlockquoteJun 01, 2020 01:00 PMGreetings from Amazon,Thank you for your prompt reply and for your understanding on this matter.We will request the FC staff to set your item as Unfulfillable so you can place a removal order for it from your Seller Central account, and this way have the item returned to you.If you require assistance from Selling Partner Support placing a removal order, you may use the link below to contact them:http://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/contact-us/contact-amazon-form.html//At the bottom of the page, you will see the option “Need More Help” and click on the “Get Support” button.

FNSKU Labels and Prep Centers (GTIN Exempt),Fulfillment By Amazon,General FBA Questions,"Hello everyone,I was trying to get an answer to my question from Amazon support, but they keep sending me their general guidance bullets without answering the question. So I’m here.I’m currently selling FBM and was thinking about going FBA. This requires me to send my inventory to the FBA center. When trying to create a shipment to an FBA fulfillment center, I selected “Who preps” as Amazon, and “Who labels” as Amazon too. But further in the process I was told that I had to affix the FNSKU labels to my products myself – the products are not eligible for Amazon Labeling Service even for a fee, because I do not have any scannable or readable manufacturer’s code on the product (any sort of, none). I am the manufacturer and the only seller of my product, I applied for and was granted the GTIN exemption. My problem (apart from the fact that I will have to process 900+ units one by one) is that the product is rather small and the packaging both by design and shape does not allow for affixing the FNSKU labels on it the way Amazon wants (it is a small cardboard tube 5 inches tall and 5 inches in diameter, all the surface is used for product information and branding). The only side where the FNSKU label could theoretically be affixed to, is the bottom. But here is another problem – the FNSKU label size is larger than the bottom part of the tube! I asked the Amazon support if I could downscale the FNSKU label to fit the bottom and if the bottom was the part of the packaging where I could affix it. They could not provide me with any clear answer as if they were not reading the message (I even enclosed the photo of my product and the label so that they could see that the label would not fit).I would be very grateful if someone could answer these questions for me:can I affix the FNSKU label to the bottom of my product packaging instead of any other side?can I downscale the FNSKU label a bit to fit the area it will be affixed to?is there any reliable prep center in Minnesota (preferably) to handle all the labeling (currently my products are packed in what is probably known as “master cartons” – a cardboard box where the tubes are sitting in several rows with bubble wrap added to avoid damage, so effectively it is about opening each of those master cartons, taking all of the content out (one by one), labeling each of the tubes, and packing them all back into those master cartons – can’t even imagine how much this could cost me!).Any suggestion would be highly appreciated.Thank you.",https://sellercentral.amazon.com/forums/t/fnsku-labels-and-prep-centers-gtin-exempt/629560

"Amazon has sidelined fulfilling FBA products, won’t deliver for a month to Prime customers",Fulfillment By Amazon,General FBA Questions,"So yesterday I had put in my Amazon cart a VGA cable as since I’ll be working from home, I needed to set up a 2nd monitor. I had carefully selected a Prime product that would “deliver by Wednesday.” Today, I went to finalize my order and found out that now it will deliver by April 21st.So I got suspicious, and I started looking at our company’s repertoire of FBA products that aren’t in the select 4 categories.In toy, only 1 out of 15 products still has the Prime badge, and the rest won’t deliver for a month.Home fared a little better with about 20% still rating a Prime badge. They all politely say free shipping to Prime members … but no prime badge and you’ll get it 1 month from now if you are a Prime member and by April 30th if you are non-Prime.No announcement of this either to the sellers or the public.Now if Amazon had a) made an announcement and b) informed us that they are not charging us monthly storage fees since they have product they are keeping they won’t ship and c) that they also inform us they will reduce our pick and pack fees since customers are no longer getting expedited shipping, … then I wouldn’t be so disgusted.Note that among all these products are products that people genuinely need like I need this cable to keep doing my job and therefore support myself.So I’m off braving the big bad world to look for my VGA cable at Walmart. We aren’t under full stay at home order here in KY yet, just no groups, social distancing, etc. so this is do-able but risky for me, but for many of you, you just lost your last safe option to get some necessary items for a month … that just don’t happen to be in grocery/pet/health/BISS categories.Becky in KY",https://sellercentral.amazon.com/forums/t/amazon-has-sidelined-fulfilling-fba-products-wont-deliver-for-a-month-to-prime-customers/596076

SFP losing buy box to FBA despite 5 week FBA shipping delay,Fulfillment By Amazon,FBA Orders and Customer Service,"Just started this case with Amazon, any other sellers seeing this?…Regarding the extended delivery times for non-essential items, I have noticed that several offers we have currently enrolled in SFP are not getting into the buy box when going up against equal priced FBA offers, even though we are able to deliver the units within the 2 day SFP shipping window and FBA sellers have delivery dates that are weeks out. With such demand being put on FC’s during these challenging times we just want to bring it to your attention that as SFP sellers we are able to alleviate some of that demand on FC’s while maintaining the customer experience Prime members have come to expect. Not offering the fastest potential shipping method is causing a negative experience for our mutual customers and leading to lost sales.Please see the attached screenshots for an example where an FBA offer is winning the Buy-box: ASIN B076585D8J. In this instance the item won’t arrive until 5/4. For the same price the customer could purchase from us and receive the unit as early as 3/31 via SFP. This listing doesn’t even show 3/31 as the fastest delivery option, you have to click into “the other sellers on Amazon” view to see our Offer.We have maintained our SFP metrics for years and are able to deliver products to customers within the SFP shipping window. But, customers purchasing the item from an FBA seller will need to wait weeks to receive the order. If there was a way to take this into consideration over the coming weeks we as SFP sellers can help alleviate the stress on FCs while maintaining the high level of customer service Prime members expect.Will FBA units with extended ship times lose their prime badge?Will measures be taken to factor the faster ship times SFP sellers can provide for non-essential items and the ability of SFP sellers to maintain the Amazon Prime member experience?vault snip 2 with delivery date.PNG1920×1047 388 KB",https://sellercentral.amazon.com/forums/t/sfp-losing-buy-box-to-fba-despite-5-week-fba-shipping-delay/598613

I already got the FNSKU codes, deleting it will be now OK.Does anyone have any prior experience in this process and have you gotten into trouble for trying to transition?Any advice will be helpful.Thank you.Regards,",https://sellercentral.amazon.com/forums/t/regarding-transitioning-of-sales-for-the-same-asin-on-2-approved-seller-central-accounts/622227

YesDid the product pass drop test? YesWas the box recommendation followed? YesDoes the box recommendation make sense based on the box and items shipped with this order? Yes”Seller Support concluded their analysis of the problem by saying “your box recommendation has been considered.”I wrote back, asking what their reply meant, and noting the ASINs are fragile, subject to breakage caused by machine handling or by having much heavier packages fall on them - that a simple drop test doesn’t adequately address the problem of breakage for fragile products.Seller Central responded back by quoting chapter and verse of the prep requirements:“The units were improperly prepared prior to being sent to an Amazon fulfillment center.Products you send to FBA must be ready to be packed for shipment to the customer. No additional preparation should be needed to store and pack your products. Any additional preparation or labeling required upon receipt at the fulfillment center causes delays and may result in charges for unplanned preparation or for non-compliance with FBA policies and requirements.The units on your shipment required bubble wrapping.Units that are fragile, made of glass, or are sharp may require additional bubble wrapping to be safely received at an Amazon fulfillment center. Make sure your packaged units can pass a 3-foot drop test onto a hard surface without breaking or leaking. A drop test consists of five drops:- Flat on base- Flat on top- Flat on longest side- Flat on shortest side- On a corner• DO NOT leave empty space in the package, which may lower the chance of the product’s ability to pass the 3-foot drop test.”I’m struggling to provide a great customer experience, but it appears the economics of a bag versus a box is getting in the way. The problem seems particularly prevalent now that the shipping venues are all jammed, packages are moving at higher velocity, and are more likely to be dropped (or thrown) one on top of one another.How can I get to the other side of the matter, and have Seller Support consider consumers’ negative experience?",https://sellercentral.amazon.com/forums/t/ncx-for-crushed-item-that-passed-drop-test/620930
Customer orders not being shipped to customers and therefore cannot ship inventory (max reached),Fulfillment By Amazon,General FBA Questions,"I’m having a huge issue with one of my ASINs. It’s an oversized item and is a high demand item for the product type (selling quite a few units per day every single day). I checked the Restock Inventory page regularly to see when and if I can ship in more units.Today I found the “Utilization” (total units in Amazon FC including customer orders) for this ASIN stayed the same for 3 days and it currently exceeds my Maximum so I cannot ship more in.I found it weird because it’s not happened like this before so I checked the transaction view of my account balance and it showed the last time Amazon shipped this ASIN to customer was 4/26 (4 days ago).This is a big problem becauseI cannot ship more in obviously (Utilization > Max) and I’m out of stockthe Max allowed continues to decrease because it is based on sales in the last 30 days, and the longer I’m out of stock the “total units sold in last 30 days” will continue to decrease, driving down my Max allowedIt’s a downward spiral meaning I will never be able to ship in any units because the gap between Utilization and Max continues to widen.Does anyone have this problem with your ASIN? that Amazon is no longer shipping your order to customers? I’ve got hundreds of customer orders not being shipped to customers for multiple days already…",https://sellercentral.amazon.com/forums/t/customer-orders-not-being-shipped-to-customers-and-therefore-cannot-ship-inventory-max-reached/620460
